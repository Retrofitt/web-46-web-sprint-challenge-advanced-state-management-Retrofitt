# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What problem does the context API help solve?
    passing down props over and over again
2. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?
    the store stores state, reducers handle changes to state, and actions are tell the reducer what to do.
3. What does `redux-thunk` allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?
    lets us create action creators that return functions instead of actions
4. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!
    honestly i really enjoyed each system but context api seemed the easiest and most convenient due to its simplicity by comparison, so i rather enjoyed it the most.
